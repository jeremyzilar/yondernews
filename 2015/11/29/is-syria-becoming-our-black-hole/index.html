                    former Yugoslavia. Since Yugoslavia and Syria were both
                    multinational countries, and were both kept together by
                    strong leaders like Tito and Assad, while their strategic
                    geographical positions helped them to secure their
                    international status, the comparison of the two countries is
                    legitimate. And yet, even as we are all alarmed by the
                    immense tragedy in Syria and enraged by the callousness of
                    the world’s superpowers, I am also shocked by how short the
                    human memory is. In only 25 years, we have already forgotten
                    the bloodshed and the endless victims that human cruelty
                    created.

                    beginning: it was the extreme nationalism proposed as the
                    remedy for the country’s social and economic problems. It
                    was a domestic war, fought locally while the international
                    community stood aside as a passive observer. At least, this
                    was the case during the first few years, when everyone from
                    Brussels, Washington and Moscow were hoping that the Serbian
                    leader, Slobodan Milošević, would become a new strongman who
                    could keep the Balkan powder keg unexploded. But they picked
                    the wrong  man, because Milošević was the cause of the
                    growing tensions among the various ethnicities whose
                    interests were jeopardized by his one-sided decisions
                    &#8211; something that was never the case in post-WWII
                    Yugoslavia. Then the NATO bombing came at the end of the
                    long and bloody war, which concluded with the terrible
                    massacre of Muslims in Srebrenica under the watch of the
                    U.N. peace forces.

                    kidnapping of Aldo Moro on the Via Fani in Rome. Moro was
                    the former prime minister of Italy and was kidnapped while
                    on his way to parliament to announce an agreement between
                    his own Christian Democratic Party and the Italian Communist
                    Party (CPI) to form a coalition government. In the aftermath
                    of heavy blows by left- and right-wing terrorist groups,
                    Italy was in permanent political crisis, and the country’s
                    two major parties had agreed to end hostilities and run the
                    country together. In other words, the Christian Democrats
                    and the Communists were ready to end their cold war. If they
                    had succeeded, Italy would have put aside their post-war
                    ideologies two decades before the fall of the Berlin Wall!

                    The way it ended in Via Fani made us understand that the
                    kidnapping and killing of Aldo Moro was a masterpiece by the
                    forces that wanted to stop Italy from becoming politically

                      on record there—destroyed agriculture, causing many farm
                      families to migrate to cities. The influx added to social
                      stresses already created by refugees pouring in from the
                      war in Iraq, explains Richard Seager, a climate scientist
                      at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
                      who co-authored the study. The drought also pushed up food
                      prices, aggravating poverty. “We’re not saying the drought
                      caused the war,” Seager said. “We’re saying that added to
                      all the other stressors, it helped kick things over the
                      threshold into open conflict. And a drought of that
                      severity was made much more likely by the ongoing
                      human-driven drying of that region.</span

                    promise they gave to Russia when the latter consented the
                    unification of the two Germanies. According to ambassador
                    Matlock, NATO did not keep its promise that it wouldn’t
                    expand towards the East.

                    and then to the Balkans &#8211; who broke the promise that
                    America gave to Russia after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
                    Among the American government’s other mistakes, the speakers
                    also mentioned disrespect towards Russians after Ronald
                    Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev signed the historic agreement.
                    “We behaved like we achieved victory in a war and not a
                    partner with whom we could resolve the problems of the world

                      aggression, or Russia&#8217;s aggression, is, if not
                      100-percent false, let us say, for the sake of being
                      balanced and ecumenical, it&#8217;s 50-percent false. And
                      if Washington would admit that its narrative is 50-percent
                      false, which means Russia&#8217;s narrative is 50-percent
                      correct, that&#8217;s where negotiations begin and
                      succeed.

                    >If you ask me, Cohen and the other panelists who appeared
                    with him at NYU are quite reasonable. They were discussing
                    the effort that the U.S. and Russia have to make in order to
                    resolve the mess they’ve created in the Middle East. But
                    there is something that tells me that this might be very
                    difficult to achieve. Even if people like Cohen prevail in
                    America, and Washington accepts Putin as a partner
                    (something that, in my mind, he never completely ceased to
                    be), then the two sides will have to find a new language and
                    a new set of rules. It will not happen overnight. And it
                    will not be easy, even if America ditches Saudi Arabia, a
                    country that &#8211; like Turkey, Qatar and other Gulf
                    countries &#8211; finances ISIS. Would Iran, replacing the
                    Saudis as an ally and therefore as a new regional policeman,
                    be acceptable for all the partners of the new alliance?
                    Acceptable for Israel, Turkey? Would the Russians go for it?

                    longtime friends with the Saudi royal family, are no longer
                    the reigning family in the U.S. It is long past time to make
                    some new moves and redo the constellations of politics.

                    >And second, for which I hope I will not be called a racist;
                    my secret speculation is that, as much as Putin acts macho
                    and touts his history as a policeman, he is uncomfortable
                    with a black American president. That makes me think that
                    the Republicans, who hate Obama for similar reasons, might
                    have more success in resetting the dialogue with Russia.
                    More so even than Clinton, perhaps. Because if there is one
                    difference between Americans and Russians, it is their
                    memory. Russians do not forget.
