                    of the alleged Russian hacking during the November
                    elections. At least, that is what the president-elect
                    promised during his first press conference in months, just
                    nine days before he is to be sworn as the new president.
                    Trump’s words made it sound as though, with his own
                    intelligence agencies in command, he will be in position to
                    rewrite history. Nothing will ever be the same again, Trump
                    seems to warn his citizens from high up in his golden tower.

                    word or two on what he intends to do to improve the
                    wellbeing of America’s jobless citizens. It would be polite
                    and normal. Instead, Trump announced that he was planning
                    revenge. He was enraged, but seemingly under control until
                    half an hour into the conference, when he completely lost
                    it. He was rude to journalists who did not fit his mood,
                    praising the apparently well-behaved others who kept silent.
                    He was like a furious god distributing justice and
                    punishment; calling whoever authorized the dossier of
                    unverified information against him a Nazi; showing renewed

                    had to say. They were there doing their job. And yet, for
                    the first time during these months of long national dispute
                    about the Russian hacking, he admitted that Russia &#8212;
                    that Putin &#8212; had a hand in it.

                    the pressure was such that he had to acknowledge the
                    reports. He had to listen. There was no other way, since
                    President Obama ordered sanctions against the spying and
                    hacking Russians based on the same intelligence reports.
                    This was one of the big differences between the two men.
                    Obama trusted the agencies’ info and used it in his way and
                    for his purposes, while Trump does not trust the agencies
                    that are supposed to protect the nation. He thinks that they
                    should only protect him. That is why he openly confronted
                    them, attacked them and declared them incapable of doing
                    their jobs. This attitude increased the feeling of
                    uncertainty and confusion in the country, and consequently
                    reduced the popularity of the president-elect even before
                    he’s scheduled to take office.

                    a hunt after him using legal, nonviolent means. There are a

                    forced to step down. In short, I am inclined to believe that

                    However, it’s now clear why the American news organizations
                    that do not have their own investigative sources could not

                    could not do it because they simply could not substantiate
                    what they read. At least, this is what they are saying. But
                    from what I read, it seems pretty clear that this is a
                    fabricated story. And one does not have to be a spy to see
                    that. So perhaps the president-elect was right on this one.
                    Less so when he tweeted that, “Intelligence agencies should
                    never have allowed this fake news to ‘leak’ into the public.
                    One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?” But in
                    principle, he was right.

                    myth that intel agencies had something concrete against
                    Trump. It took away their leverage against him. On the other
                    hand, Trump was finally forced to acknowledge the evidence
                    of Russian meddling in American affairs. The battlefield
                    will now move to a new territory &#8212; perhaps to the

                    Bannon sitting in the back of Trump’s office. Compared to
                    the language that the president-elect uses, the alliances
                    that Brooks writes about seem to be gigantic. In other
                    words, that table covered with piles of papers that we saw
                    during the press conference is an important story. It is

                    public opinion decide to follow? It’s a trick that we began
                    to understand once Trump started to repeat it every day.
                    What the president-elect tweets day by day is not important
