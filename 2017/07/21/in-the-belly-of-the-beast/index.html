                    July 6 sailed out of Brooklyn Harbor towards Southampton,
                    England. A few days into the cruise, as we were sitting in
                    one of the restaurants on the Queen, fascination with the
                    power and sheer mass of this boat had already settled in.

                    tweets, his idiocy, his power. Unbelievably slow and yet
                    extremely expensive internet helped us support the choice to
                    turn our backs on the political and media chatter back in
                    D.C. The impression was that almost everyone on the boat
                    couldn&#8217;t care less about Trump and Putin’s tête-à-tête
                    in Hamburg during the G20, an event that back on

                    time they offered us the patient’s room, I was told that she
                    was out of mortal danger, but the Queen had to land in
                    Halifax to secure the right treatment to the passenger in

                    before the captain found time to read us security
                    instructions over the loudspeakers. Then we were ordered to
                    try on our life jackets. I still do not know what the
                    purpose of this exercise was. To honor the captain’s voice?
                     We were listening to the master’s voice for seven days in a
                    row, every noontime. It was telling us the position of the
                    boat, which we were sailing just miles away from the wrecked
                    Titanic, or the place where the perfect storm, with its 18
                    meter high waves, swallowed George Clooney’s fishing boat.
                    Not funny! Then every second day, the captain told us to
                    move our watches an hour&#8211; something that did not make
                    sense since we all were living in a complete time and

                    reception for the people who were able to put on a dinner
                    jacket or tuxedo. Many people did since Queen Mary 2 is a
                    lot about the dress code and misplaced nostalgia for the
                    past. People dressed up for the dinners, for the cocktail
                    parties. There are many opportunities to dress up on the
                    boat like this. In that sense, the Queen Mary seemed to want
                    to replicate the mythical glamor the Titanic was known for.
                    That is before it sank. Besides, there were Broadway shows,

                    masked grand gala ball); gazillions of little hobby

                    restaurants on the seventh deck, there was also the main
                    boardwalk, a big enough deck for joggers and deck chairs
                    that run around the boat. The main bars (quite a good jazz
                    club) were distributed between the second and the third
                    deck, where there was also the main reception and Britannia,
                    the biggest restaurant, with enough seats for 1100 people.
                    It’s huge, served by 146 chefs that can daily prepare 2500
                    meals in two seatings. But to be able to get through the
                    tight security of the very formal and strict headwaters and
                    get a seat, you need to wear at least some sort of jacket. I
                    needed to borrow a tie a couple of times to pass the
                    “guards.” But otherwise, it was our place, since we were
                    traveling with a New York Times group of journalists and
                    readers. It was the most interesting group of the people on
                    the boat to be with because some of the known journalists
                    (my wife among them) were lecturing, but also because the
                    Times readers were all knowledgeable and nice people,
                    interesting to talk to.</span

                    our cruise, was full of retired people who needed to
                    socialize and, as my wife said, had enough money to do it.
                    This was something that crew members confirmed during the
                    numerous chats I had with them. After I realized that the

                    At least this was the case during my journey. Perhaps I
                    noticed it more because there was a dense fog that prevented
                    us from sitting on the deck, as I was hoping to do for the
                    whole trip. Since the ocean offered little or nothing more
                    than a dense cold the whole way of the crossing, I only saw
                    one bird, the name of which I do not know, and one seagull.
                    Our attention turned instead to what was happening inside

                    >Nothing much, the tired faces of the crew told me by the
                    end of the cruise. They work long hours but, coming from the
                    Philippines&#8211;half of the 1200 crew&#8211;and countries
                    of former Yugoslavia where the incomes are low, these people
                    work hard to save some money to send it back home. They tell
                    you how Cunard, the owner of the big fleet of cruise ships,
                    is reducing the salaries and even the internet, an important
                    way to stay in touch with family, and is getting slower and
                    slower. If they stay on the boat long enough the crew
                    members do get a promotion and a contract that lets them
                    stay at home for longer periods of time at least a couple of
                    times a year. But while they sail, they work and sleep under
                    the deck in the what appear to be very small cabins. They
                    sometimes are able to get on the ground for a few hours, but
                    only part of the crew at a time because the management knows
                    that these folks, like all sailors for centuries, do get
                    wild when they get into the harbors. And the next day the
                    damn ship has to load on and carry more passengers with deep
                    pockets.  </span

                    >For most of the people, the major activity on the boat was
                    eating. The food was free and available 24/7, at least in
                    the huge King’s Court self-service restaurant where the
                    quality of the food was almost as high if not the same as in
                    the other seated and fancy places. So people, ordinary
                    people, were eating and discussing the food at all times.
                    Then they were going to the events or reading the leaflets
                    with the schedule of events, using the maps of the boat in
                    order to orient themselves. Those were the clients, the
                    slow-motion customers who bring millions of dollars of
                    revenue to Cunard with every crossing. So by the end of the
                    seventh day, when the fog lifted and we finally saw the
                    boring shore of Southampton, I was happy. We finally were
                    able to be expelled from the belly of the big whale and to
                    set our life back on track. And my wife, me and friends from
                    the New York Times were able to go back to their journalist
                    and editor jobs. Because getting off of the Queen Mary 2,
                    where they were treated like simple entertainers, did not
                    boost their professional dignity.

                    Dick away. Who knows, perhaps one day it may be useful, and
                    perhaps the big whale is actually among us, sitting in the
                    White House.</span
