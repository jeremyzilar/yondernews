                    told the bartender who stood behind the huge bar in the
                    atrium of the Old Post Office. The building, which is
                    standing in the heart of capital, has been transformed into
                    a hotel by Donald Trump. In it, the huge bar resembles the
                    command bridge of a transatlantic ship, and the bartender
                    has the physique of a security guard. And yes, he was happy.

                    decent &#8212; then moved to the man next to me, who was
                    chatting with two ladies further down the bar. He ordered
                    his second mojito. “He should do this kind of thing and not
                    get involved with politics,” I heard one of ladies telling

                    gathered around the bar was in the place for him: the real
                    estate billionaire who managed to get his hands on the huge
                    building &#8212; much bigger than the White House just a few
                    blocks away. That’s why I was there, too. I wanted to see if
                    the newly opened hotel was doing any better than the golden
                    Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York that I visited
                    recently. Trump’s New York headquarters gave me the
                    impression that it was in the twilight of its years. Short
                    on customers and visitors, the big, silent place almost
                    seemed as to be getting a bit rusty.  </span

                    filled with an endless collection of crystal glass whisky
                    bottles, the building’s atrium is no doubt much more alive
                    than Trump Tower’s empty halls and restaurants. The Old Post
                    Office is enormous, and could easily serve as a concert hall
                    or even a basketball arena. It would not be so elaborate if
                    not for Trump, who used the steel structure that supports
                    the glass ceiling to hang murano chandeliers, which he then
                    forgot to light. It was early evening, and aside from two
                    dozen of us sitting on the tall stools at the main bar,
                    there were other people seated in comfortable armchairs
                    around the low bar tables scattered across the ground floor
                    of the atrium. The tables in the mezzanine restaurant that
                    served an early dinner were pretty full. But I didn’t see
                    anybody checking in or out at the various reception desks,
                    nor any cars coming or going in front of the hotel, which is
                    meant to be the biggest and most luxurious of its kind, as
                    Trump announced &#8212; and the most expensive, too, as
                    cynics added. How else can Trump bring back the $200 million
                    that he spent on transforming an abandoned “cathedral in the
                    desert” into the jewel of the hotel industry?

                    banned from coming in here,” he said angrily about the two
                    ladies down the bar, who obviously did not like Trump as a
                    politician. I asked him why he likes Trump, and he told me
                    his name was Scarface. Yes, an Al Pacino type &#8212; or
                    rather, Tony Montana, the determined Cuban immigrant who
                    took over a drug cartel in Miami in the 1983 Brian de Palma

                    might turn into a financial disaster. One of the most
                    frequent observations is that in order to cover the cost of
                    the renovation and lease &#8212; the building is still owned
                    by the GSA &#8212; the hotel rooms  would have to be

                      At the time, Ivanka Trump responded angrily that
                      &#8220;his numbers are pure speculation and, simply put,
                      wrong.&#8221;</span

                      between $735 and $995 a night. On many days, the hotel is
                      as expensive or more so than the Four Seasons. (Ivanka
                      Trump had said that Trump Organization originally aimed to
                      have lower rates than this high-end hotel.) And it&#8217;s
                      not at all clear whether Trump&#8217;s hotel can command
                      such steep rates in a market already crowded with luxury
                      hotels—especially because Trump&#8217;s hotel will lack
                      some of the amenities initially promised.</span

                      restaurants. He had originally signed up two celebrity
                      chefs, José Andrés and Geoffrey Zakarian, to open highly
                      anticipated restaurants in the hotel. Then Trump launched
                      his presidential bid by calling Mexican immigrants rapists
                      and criminals, and both restaurateurs backed out. Trump is
                      now suing each of them. The ongoing litigation has
                      generated heaps of bad press for Trump. The lawsuits,
                      coupled with Trump&#8217;s controversial statements on the
                      campaign trail, have also made the project toxic to other
                      well-known chefs who have apparently steered clear of the

                      Andrés and Zakarian backed out. But he quickly turned down
                      the offer. Colicchio says he was put off by the way the
                      Trumps had treated Andrés, a friend, and by the GOP
                      candidate&#8217;s comments about immigrants.</span

                      Trump&#8217;s standing in the restaurant community and
                      Trump&#8217;s comments on immigrants have made it tough to
                      work with the reality television mogul. &#8220;He&#8217;s
                      clearly a racist and makes racist comments, and we have an
                      industry that has always reached out to an immigrant
                      population and built on the work of an immigrant
                      population,&#8221; Colicchio says. &#8220;I think that the
                      remarks [Trump] makes would make it very difficult for
                      anyone to stand up in front of their staff and want to be

                      The loss of Andrés and Zakarian could affect the
                      hotel&#8217;s profitability. The contracts they signed
                      were quite lucrative for Trump. Under the deals, the chefs
                      would have owned the restaurants, footed the bill for
                      millions of dollars in renovation costs, and been fully
                      responsible for any losses their operations sustained.
                      Andrés and Zakarian would have paid rent and a percentage
                      of their profits to Trump. The hotel, meanwhile, would
                      have benefited from hosting two destination restaurants
                      with almost no financial risk.
