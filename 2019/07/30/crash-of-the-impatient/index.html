                      few weeks. And I cannot let Yonder go silent. So with some
                      of my friends, we started to think about how to keep
                      Yonder alive during my period of healing. The first week,
                      the solution could not be better. My wife

                    Washington D.C. its nickname, The Swamp. I was slower than

                    crested the hill and searched ahead for Andrej. No biker to
                    be seen. Annoying. He has a bad tendency of speeding ahead
                    and not waiting for me.</span

                    – there was blood everywhere it seemed. He’d hit a pothole,
                    said two men who had run to help. He’d flown over the
                    handlebars. His helmet and bike had flown in different
                    directions and were lying near the curb some 20 feet

                    I examined his head and saw the blood was not coming from
                    his ear, but from a cut near his chin. I looked through his
                    hair – no lacerations, just a bit of bruising. The helmet

                    squad that I trained as a physician and once practiced in an
                    ER so they would pay attention to my observations. But I was
                    happy to turn the care over to them and to become just a
                    very worried and slightly too-knowledgeable spouse. (I

                    (a woman!) said the first x-ray showed a likely broken rib
                    or two and a broken clavicle. Those injuries were not as
                    terrible as I’d feared. The messenger, as well as much of
                    the trauma team, were female, an unthinkable reality when I
                    worked in an ER 25 years ago, where the trauma team was the
                    cocky cowboys of the hospital. </span

                    drain the blood in his chest cavity, allowing the lung to
                    re-inflate. Once again I was ejected from the room so a

                    every four hours, with an extra dose IV if needed. When I
                    went to the pharmacy to fill his prescription for
                    painkillers, he’d been given a total of five pills. Five! He
                    wouldn’t make it through the night on that. In the news each
                    day, we hear that America’s opiate epidemic is fueled by the
                    overprescribing of prescription pain pills. But in Andrej’s
                    case, the pendulum had swung way too far in the other
                    direction.</span

                    unused prescription for painkillers in the medicine chest. I
                    dusted off my medical knowledge and looked up how to convert
                    the doses of one opiate to the other. For nearly a week, I
                    played MD again, maxing out safe doses of every painkiller
                    we had: opiates, Tylenol, Advil, lidocaine pain patches. I
                    even got my hands on some marijuana gummies in the hopes
                    that would help. </span

                    in his haste to flee the coup, clearly hadn’t read) was not
                    helpful at all: The diagnosis was incomplete. There were two
                    slings, but no instructions about when and how to wear them.
                    There were four pages of printed instructions about tetanus
                    shots. But nothing about shoulder fractures, rib fractures
                    or the finger fracture. I know in the grand scheme of things
                    the finger fracture wouldn’t kill him but, still, it had
                    never been splinted. </span

                    for each type of fracture (rib, collarbone, and finger). In
                    U.S. medicine, every body part has its own specialist and no
                    one seems to think much about the whole person. </span

                    his care? Were we supposed to fly blind until then? What
                    happens to patients who don’t have a medical professional as

                    but, mysteriously, physical therapists immediately began
                    calling, wanting to come to our house to treat him at home.
                    When the first one arrived, she had no idea of his injuries,
                    nor access to his x-rays. We had no idea who had ordered the
                    treatment – which doctor, for which body part? His shoulder
                    was too painful to move at all. His ribs didn’t need PT. We
                    sent the physical therapists away. Does everyone who leaves
                    the trauma service automatically get a dozen sessions of
                    home PT? That’s a good way to make money. Don’t let them in
                    the door, I told him. I didn’t want us or our insurer to
                    pay. </span

                    finally went out with Shannon and Greg for that dinner. 
                    After a few frustrating phone calls and several visits to
                    the hospital, Andrej’s pain is under control, though it will
                    be a long haul to full recovery. After a few irate phone
                    calls to various clinics from me, “Dr. Rosenthal,” Andrej
                    has managed to see the specialist for each body part. They
                    were great, and we have a good plan for his
                    recuperation.  </span

                    (doctors for about 10 days at that point) who poked their
                    heads behind the curtain just to ask how he was doing.  ICU
                    nurses. The orthopedist who just yesterday gave us advice
                    for how to heal his shoulder. They are amazing people, but
                    boy do they work in a messed up system. And now that he’s
