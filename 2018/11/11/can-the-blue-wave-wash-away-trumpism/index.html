                    organized an open house, inviting friends and people from
                    all walks of life to watch the results. The TV ran, but
                    instead of staring at the screen and following the constant
                    predictions of electoral victories and losses, people were
                    interacting and getting to know each other. There was
                    practically no politics mentioned, as the people in the room
                    were evidently oversaturated with political debate. Around
                    midnight, I think, one person announced that the Democrats
                    had won the House, but &#8212; he opined &#8212; Trump won

                    America. It was somewhat grotesque. There is nothing new
                    about the 78-years-old Pelosi. With ballots still being
                    counted, the minority leader rushed on stage, surrounded by
                    her colorful staff and two underage grandsons, and claimed
                    her place as next speaker of the House, declaring that her

                    center-left coalitions, by claiming they’ve lost contact

                    took advantage of. Žižek, a controversial Slovenian
                    philosopher, says the point is not the Trumpian caricature,
                    but the inability of the center-left to ask and answer
                    fundamental questions which should focus on how we cope with
                    the global power of capital. In short, the incapacity of the
                    center-left political class to articulate the issues that
                    derive, yes, from the might of global capital, and
                    consequently from the exponential growth and impact of
                    technology on our lives, causing job loss, climate change
                    and so many of our contemporary crises.

                    existence. People like Trump and Bannon are unconcerned with
                    such longevity, preferring to take the easy way. They flee

                    underlying problems of this world be resolved? I am afraid
                    that the old dichotomy between left and right is no longer

                    side to think better as we, two years ago, secretly hope he
                    would. Nevermind thinking together. And as far as the

                    to achieve his legislative ambitions; it could also
                    intensify the state of crisis and siege in Washington. The
                    loss in the House of Representatives means that an array of
                    committees—Judiciary, Intelligence, Ways and Means, Foreign
                    Affairs, and others—will now be chaired by Democrats who can
                    initiate, or accelerate, investigations into Trump’s past,
                    his Presidency, and his associates. They replace Republican
                    chairmen like Devin Nunes, who, as the chairman of the House
                    Intelligence Committee, often seemed to act as  like a
                    detached lawmaker and more like the President’s personal

                    War I generals. He no longer quoted lines from movies but
                    from Gorski vijenac (The Mountain Wreath), the 19th-century
                    epic poem about the Serbs’ righteous extermination of

                    entirely alien to the urban spirit of Sarajevo, where we
                    both grew up, and I frequently told him so. It got to the
                    point where we were likely to spiral into an argument
                    whenever we saw each other. I’d often insist, before getting
                    wound up myself, that we avoid “politics” and stick instead
                    to soccer and movies, but by the time the war started in

                      our continued conversation. I had long been screaming into
                      a human void.</span

                    >announced that Steve Bannon was invited to a conversation
                    with editor-in-chief David Remnick, Hemon recalled his
                    memories of Zoka. “I was so upset that I rushed to a
                    conclusion that Bannon’s fascism was, for The New Yorker,
                    merely a difference of opinion that could be publicly
                    debated for the intellectual enjoyment of its paying
                    audience,” writes Hemon, adding: “The public discussion
                    prompted by the (dis)invitation confirmed to me that only
                    those safe from fascism and its practices are likely to
                    think that there might be a benefit in exchanging ideas with
                    fascists. What for such a privileged group is a matter of a
                    potentially productive difference in opinion is, for many of
                    us, a matter of basic survival. The essential quality of
                    fascism (and its attendant racism) is that it kills people
                    and destroys their lives—and it does so because it openly
                    aims so.”</span

                    >I was sitting in the bar near my house in the North West of
                    D.C. when I heard something similar. A couple sitting next
                    to me was having varied conversations; a young man,
                    confessing his life to a woman who sounded more experienced,
                    was leading the conversation. I do not recall how they
                    passed onto Bannon and the New Yorker. I listened, curious,
                    then engaged the couple, asking them why they thought
                    Remnick invited him. They were angry. I become even more
                    curious and proposed possible explanations that were
                    churning in my mind. After a few attempts to direct the
                    debate toward reason, they cut me short and ridiculed me.
                    The conversation ended with them saying: “We don’t give a
                    shit what might be the reason for the invitation of Bannon
                    on the New Yorker stage. He is racist, and for us blacks,
                    this is favoring someone who is doing us a lot of harm.” I
                    apologized, having never considered their race. It was the
                    reaction Hemon describes in his piece: “The catastrophic
                    error would’ve been in allowing Bannon to divorce his ideas
                    from the fascist practices in which they’re actualized with
                    brutality. If he is at all relevant, it is not as a thinker,
                    but as a (former) executive who has worked to build the
                    Trumpist edifice of power that cages children and is
                    dismantling mechanisms of democracy.”</span

                    >Both the couple from the bar and Hemon used strong words,
                    opinions to be respected. Their sharp, uncompromising
                    thinking marks a red line, a kind of taboo that the human
                    race established after WWII. We were brought up to believe
                    that the tremendous war will never happen again, that Nazism
                    has gone forever, that the postwar realization injected in
                    us enough antifascist corps to prevent a new epidemic
                    forever. It did not. Look to the massacres that followed the
                    secession of Yugoslavia, the reemerging racism around the
                    world, the genocide of Rohingya in Myanmar. Look what has
                    been happening to the black American minority on the streets
                    of this country for centuries. I get Hemon&#8211;he is from
                    tortured Sarajevo&#8211;and his wife, so he writes, is
                    African American. It is significant that two years ago, </span

                    lost faith in words and ballots, now calling for a struggle
                    in which anti-fascist forces must clearly identify the enemy
                    and commit to defeating them, whoever they are, whatever it
                    takes. “The time of conversations with fascists is over,
                    even if they might be your best friend from high school,” he
                    concludes.</span

                    >The evolution of Hemon and other people who are seeing the
                    ghosts of the past haunting them is the first significant
                    damage of the Trump era. The lines are being drawn. In this
                    case, only Democrats can save America from the easily
                    digested, divisive rhetoric of Trump. Nobody outside of this
                    country can do that but them. Once this is
                    done&#8211;if&#8211;then the world will begin its reckoning
                    and resolution, aimed at addressing the pressing problems
                    that have been left aside. Let’s hope that all this can be
                    done without more bloodshed and violence. It will soon be
                    too late.</span
