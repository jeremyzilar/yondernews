                    a biography on Melania Trump by Mary Jordan, it struck me
                    that I could not remember anything relevant that the First
                    lady has ever said that would be worth publishing. Nothing I
                    have heard from Melania has ever been uplifting or even
                    depressing. In Jordan’s book, there was nothing new in what
                    Melania was saying, nothing inspiring, nothing we haven’t
                    heard before. It was as if Melania had kept repeating the
                    same mantra again and again, like this phrase, largely used
                    in Slovenian language: “The sun always shines after the
                    rain!” In the book, Melania’s expressions are packaged in
                    small blurbs and read like haikus on survivalism that
                    contain common-sense wisdom, rooted deeply in a rural
                    mindset. Melania’s words have an overtone of fatalism,
                    restraining even the tiniest glimmer of hope. Most of the
                    time, when she says something it is just a dull expression
                    of an obsolete weltanschauung. Choosing words can be either
                    an art or just the plain repetition of common sense
                    expressions that we Slovenians inherited from our rural
                    ancestors and the Habsburgs. Is it possible that Melania
                    uses them to cover-up her misanthropic nature? She may also
                    sound dull and reluctant for many reasons we do not know
                    about: perhaps because of her looks, which to her mind might
                    not be good enough for public appearance; or maybe she is
                    simply not interested or is unsure about what to say. Maybe
                    it’s because a nondisclosure contract with her husband bans
                    it. Or could she be putting the president of the U.S. on
                    ice, ignoring him because he offended her? Perhaps she
                    carries herself the way she does because her mother taught
                    her how to survive in a world governed by men; how to defend
                    herself and be desirable at the same time, a technique
                    Melania applied to Donald Trump from their first encounter
                    on.</span

                    Chance finally leaves the house, wandering aimlessly. He
                    passes a TV shop and sees himself captured by a camera in
                    the store window. Entranced, he steps backward off the
                    sidewalk and is struck by a chauffeured car, owned by mogul
                    Ben Rand. Rand&#8217;s wife Eve, who is in the car, brings
                    Chance to their home to recover. Rand is a confidant and
                    advisor to the President of the United States, whom he
                    introduces to Chance. In a discussion about the economy,
                    Chance takes his cue from the words &#8220;stimulate
                    growth&#8221; and talks about the changing seasons of the
                    garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic
                    political advice and quotes Chance in a speech. Chance now
                    rises to national prominence, attends some important
                    dinners, develops a close connection with the Soviet
                    ambassador, and appears on a television talk show during

                    should do is misunderstood as his opinion on what his

                    Melania Trump’s makeup artist of over a decade, Nicole Bryl,
                    was responsible for setting up a designated room for hair,

                    Bryl added that it takes “about one hour and 15 minutes of
                    uninterrupted focus” to do the First Lady’s makeup. But
                    there is more. The fresh news comes from Jordan’s book after
                    she interviewed the housekeepers at the Bedminster Trump
                    National Golf Club, one of the presidential couple’s
                    favorite places. “One of the worst jobs was cleaning up the
                    residue from Melania’s regular applications of tanning spray
                    to make sure any traces were removed from all the white
                    surfaces in the bathroom. The bronzer washed off in the
                    shower, and Melania used it nearly every time she left the
                    house,” the housekeeper Victorina Morales said. Is this what
                    Melania is all about? Devotion to her body? Solitude in her

                    cover-up operation, a horse parade on Pennsylvania Avenue.
                    But the transport of 400 Lipizzaner horses gets hacked by
                    Russians and becomes a cover-up for another big operation,
                    in which the initial group of plotters plays the role of
                    double agent for a Pan Slavic organization that smuggled
                    trillions of dollars from Russia into Swiss banks. In the
                    novel, a famous young pop philosopher organizes lectures and
                    workshops on film, Lacan, and Hegel in the Rose Garden of
                    the White House. The Presidential palace becomes an
                    intellectual gathering spot, a booming cultural center like
                    College de France in the age of Michel Foucault. But things
                    get complicated when the beautiful female agent, the First
                    Lady, falls in love with the famous philosopher. The
                    well-balanced spy business gets disrupted as the first lady
                    starts to take over the White House, causing the president
                    to have a massive heart attack when he realizes that his
                    wife and philosopher speak the same language.</span

                    pages of starkly different material, based on Jordan’s 44
                    minutes of phone interviews with Melania in 2016.
                    Nevertheless, the book has a fascinating opening. In the
                    first chapters of the book, Melania Trump appears smart,
                    balanced, and determined, with a strong agenda in mind.
                    Melania is portrayed as the strategist who the 45th
                    President of the U.S. depends on. She is the Melania who
                    picked Pence as vice president, the wife who scolded her
                    husband for being a wimp during the campaign, commanding him
                    to go back to fight and win the election. Melania who
                    stubbornly remained in New York for the first six months of
                    Trump’s presidency. Refusing to go to the White House from
                    day one, Melania must have remembered her mother’s advice on
                    how to use her charms (the words are mine). While she was
                    away from the White House, she became aware, Jordan wrote,
                    of the leverage she had when it came to her influence over
                    her husband. Trump’s team was pressing her to come to
                    Washington and help stabilize the President. According to
                    Jordan, Melania wanted to secure her son Barron’s position
                    with a new nuptial agreement, leveling his status to that of
                    the other four Trump children. Melania won, earning a new
                    nuptial agreement, writes Jordan. Her actions echo what
                    Veronica Lario did to her husband, tycoon, and prime
                    minister Silvio Berlusconi before she filed for
                    divorce. </span

                    >When I read the first part of the book, I thought it was
                    promising. I loved the way Jordan demonstrated the rudeness
                    of young Melania ascending the social ladder. She built good
                    working relationships with the people who helped her
                    modeling career. But as soon she managed to take it a step
                    further, when she left Ljubljana for Milan, then went to
                    Paris and eventually ended up in New York, she never looked
                    back. She cut off all contacts and past relationships. There
                    are plenty of interesting details in Jordan’s book if you
                    are interested in  Melania’s world. I for one did not know
                    that Donald Trump suffers in small spaces and how obsessed
                    he is about sleeping in his own bed. There is more.</span

                    >But, in my opinion, the interesting part of the book,
                    unfortunately, dissolves into detailed reporting of
                    Melania’s modeling career. Jordan confirms many times that
                    Melania is a so-called “commercial” model, good for catalogs
                    and advertising, but nothing like a top, career model. But
                    we kind of knew that. As I was reading the book I slowly
                    lost interest and started to wonder who on earth would like
                    to know the minutes of Melania’s life with roommates,
                    managers, rivals, in short, explaining all the petty
                    networks that helped her to climb to Trump Tower. </span

                    >It seems that Jordan got carried away by her journalistic
                    ethics to report out facts. As the facts were scarce, she
                    plunged into the microcosms of a person leading a totally
                    uninteresting life. As a consequence, there are at least two
                    Melanias in Jordan’s book. Let’s hope nobody tries will to
                    write about a third one.  </span
